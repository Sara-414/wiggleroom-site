## About the Project

The client’s most important needs were:
- A dynamic **Events Calendar** (with custom poster grids and subscription support).
- A flexible design to showcase **event posters, DJs, and rescue cats**.
- A site that could be updated by non-technical editors (venue staff and volunteers).

I customized WordPress extensively to meet those needs using **CSS, PHP, custom plugins, and theme overrides**.

## Features I Built

- **Custom Event Poster Grid**  
  - Aligned posters and event titles in a responsive grid.  
  - Fixed height/title alignment issues with CSS.  
  - Added smooth horizontal scrolling and snap points.  

- **Calendar Integration & Fixes**  
  - Customized *The Events Calendar* plugin output.  
  - Fixed header display issues, improved color scheme, and date-picker styling.  
  - Ensured subscribers could add events to personal calendars.  

- **Design & UX Enhancements**  
  - Removed Twenty Seventeen’s dark header overlay for clearer images.  
  - Added custom fonts, colors, and layout tweaks.  
  - Built SoundCloud embeds and social media integration.  

- **Custom Plugins & Snippets**  
  - Created a “Wiggle Poster Fix” plugin to wrap and align event thumbnails.  
  - Converted Code Snippets (PHP/CSS) into reusable, maintainable code.
